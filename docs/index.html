<h1>Welcome to Cloudy's googology site!</h1>
<p>The main reason I created this site is to make my own number list to provide a semi-comprehensive coverage of large numbers.</p>
<p>(introduction to be finished)</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/list">Cloudy's number list</a><ul>
<li><a href="/list/part1">Part 1</a></li>
<li><a href="/list/part2">Part 2</a></li>

<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>
<ul>
<li>2017-04-06: Today's my birthday! Unfortunately I haven't put much progress into the list since the completion of the first range of the second part, mainly because of school homework. I hope I could have better time management, so I could spend more time for homework and/or my list. Also, here's <a href="https://github.com/cloudytheconqueror/the-divine-creation">another project</a> by me that may or may not be worked further in the future.</li>
<li>2017-03-05: Completed the first range of part 2 of my list (with entries up to but not including 10,000), which took about 3 months since the last part was finished (which is longer than I expected). Before heading to larger numbers, I'll revise part 1 first.</li>
<li>2017-02-14: Happy Valentine's Day! Updated part 2 with entries up to 3003, and did some minor improvements to both parts. I'm not sure if I could continue writing my list in this pace, however; I'm being very busy lately.</li>
<li>2016-12-26: Merry (late) Christmas! Published the first (small) update of part 2 of my number list.</li>
<li>2016-11-10: It's been almost a year since the site was launched, but I finally finished writing part 1 of my list, with a grand total of 476 entries!</li>
<li>2016-08-05: This update was a bit late, but I'm finally done with the summer season of school and now have some time to work on my site. I have already released entries from 40 to 49, and soon going to release entries from 50 to 65.</li>
<li>2016-06-28: Sorry for the hiatus that was about a month long. I was busy doing final exams, and didn't have much time to contribute to it. Since the exam ended, it's time to return working on the site. Entries for 30 to 39 released.</li>
<li>2016-06-03: There's been a change of plans. My large number list will be comprised of 8 parts instead of 7 parts (this may change again), and the first part will end on 1000 instead of 1,000,000. If everything goes according to the current plan, the list (excluding infinite numbers and miscellany) will have a total of 79 ranges.</li>
<li>2016-04-27: Haven't worked on the site since late January 2016. Hopefully I could return to the site soon. In the meantime, a draft page was added to the list, providing additional entries.</li>
<li>2015-11-19: Actually started working on the list. Currently on non-positive number range.</li>
<li>2015-11-11: Site launched.</li>
