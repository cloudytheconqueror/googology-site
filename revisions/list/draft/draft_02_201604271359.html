It shows up when working with circles and trigonometric ratios and other geometric functions, as well as some other places you wouldn't expect to. It is considered a cult number for this reason, and many people calculate or memorize the digits just for the sake of it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Pi is sometimes &lt;i&gt;mistakenly&lt;/i&gt; used in googology as an attempt to trounce others, since pi's decimal digits go on forever; but pi is smaller than 4, so it can be easily beaten. A better attempt would be "pi with the decimal point removed" but that leads to an endless decimal expansion which does not equal to any finite number. A rare legitimate appearance of pi in googology is on Stirling's approximation on large factorials.</div><div><br /></div><div><b><font size="3">355/113</font></b></div><div><b><font size="3">3.141592920354...</font></b></div><div><br /></div><div>A more accurate approximation for pi (to six decimal pieces), known since antiquity.</div><div><br /></div><div><b><font size="3">Twenty-two sevenths</font></b></div><div><b><font size="3">22/7 = 3.142857142857...</font></b></div><div><br /></div><div>Another common approximation for pi.</div><div><br /></div><div><b><font size="3">One hundred sixty three</font></b></div><div><b><font size="3">163</font></b></div><div><br /></div><div>163 is the 37th prime number.</div><div><br /></div><div>Previously, people misunderstood the definition of mixed factorial (see 6561) as 1+(2*(3^(...((x-1){x-3}x)...))), when it should be (...((((1+2)*3)^4)^^5)...){x-3}x.

In the article, the number n is notated as (AAAAA...AAAAA) with n A's. The bulk of the article contains a "massive" number, which is (AAAAA...AAAAA) with 167,332 A's. Then Saibian defined Alpha as 167,332 lines of A's, each containing 75 A's, with the entire thing contained between parentheses. The result is a number with 167,332*75 = 12,549,900 A's between parentheses.</div><div><br /></div><div>Saibian decided to call the number with Alpha lines of 75 A's between ()'s Beta, and the number with Beta lines is called Gamma, and Delta and Epsilon are created in the same way. Then he devised a shorthand for these: Alpha = [A] (note the square brackets), Beta = [AA] = 941,242,500, Gamma = [AAA] = 70,593,187,500 etc.</div><div><br /></div><div>This is followed by many extensions, which began by putting Alpha A's between square brackets and giving it the notation [[A]], and then putting that many A's between square brackets and calling it [[[A]]] and so on. Then Saibian created a sequence where the first term is [A], and the terms after that are defined as [...[A]...] with the number of pairs of brackets equal to the previous term, and it gets worse from there.</div><div><br /></div><div><b><font size="3">(10^10-1)/11</font></b></div><div><b><font size="3">909,090,909</font></b></div><div><br /></div><div>The third smallest integer of the form (10^(p-1)-1)/p where p is prime (here p=11) -- this number, although its decimal expansion looks simpler, doesn't have the fascinating properties of 142,857.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Beta = [AA] = 941,242,500</b></div><div><b>Gamma = [AAA] = 70,593,187,500</b></div><div><b>Delta = [AAAA] = 5,294,489,062,500</b></div><div><br /></div><div><b><font size="3">Octal-small fry / binary-gogolcrumb / octal-guppycrumb / octal-minnowspeck</font></b></div><div><b><font size="3">2^45 = 8^15 = 35,184,372,088,832</font></b></div><div><br /></div><div>Another set of four Saibianisms with the same value.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Epsilon = [AAAAA] = 397,086,679,687,500</b></div><div><br /></div><div><b><font size="3">14^14</font></b></div><div><b><font size="3">11,112,006,825,558,016</font></b></div><div><br /></div><div>The 14th self-power.
