<div><font color="#ed106f" size="4"><b>-∞</b></font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">Negative infinity is a quantity that is less than all real numbers. It is not very useful to googology as it's not on the real number line, but it shows up when calculating the logarithm of zero (in any base), and taking the double logarithm of one.</font></div>

<div><font color="#ed106f" size="4"><b>Negative BIG FOOT</b></font></div>
<div><font color="#ed106f" size="4"><b>-FOOT<sup>10</sup>(10^100)</b></font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">This is the negative of what that is currently considered the largest named number, BIG FOOT. It is the result of applying the FOOT function to googol 10 times, where FOOT(n) is defined as the largest number definable in first-order oodle theory (FOOT for short) using x or less symbols. LittlePeng9 of Googology Wiki came up with the definition, and Sbiis Saibian suggested the name.</font></div>

<div><font color="#ed106f" size="4"><b>-Rayo(10^100)</b></font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">The negative of the former largest named number, until BIG FOOT was defined. Rayo's number is defined as the smallest number larger than any number expressable in first-order set theory with a googol or less symbols. Despite the simple definition, there's no way to compute the number.</font></div>

<div><font color="#ed106f" size="4"><b>Negative Loader's number</b></font></div>
<div><font color="#ed106f" size="4"><b>-D<sup>5</sup>(99)</b></font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">The negative of the largest named computable number, whose definition can be turned into (for example) a Turing machine instruction or a C code. Loader's number is the output of loader.c, a C program code written by Ralph Loader at the Bignum Bakeoff contest. The goal of the contest was to write a C code that produces the largest possible result on a theoretical infinite-memory machine. The C code should contain no more than 512 non-blank symbols.</font></div>
<div><br />

<div><font color="#ed106f" size="4"><b>-E100#{100}#100</b></font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">The negative of a number around the limit of Saibian's Extended Cascading-E Notation (xE^), which is currently one of the largest numbers Saibian defined using the Extensible-E system (ExE). It is not the largest number Saibian <i>named</i>—see BIG FOOT for that.</font></div>

<div><font color="#ed106f" size="4"><b>-E100#^^#100</b></font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">This the negative of a number around the limit of Saibian's Cascading-E Notation (E^), the 3rd part of the Extensible-E system. This number is much smaller than the above, but it's still large enough to be around the limit of Peano arithmetic.</font></div>

<div><font color="#ed106f" size="4"><b>-{10,10 (100) 2}</b></font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">This number is the negative of a number that is much smaller than the absolute values of the previous entries, but is still really big. It is the result of solving a 100-dimensional 10×10×...×10 hypercube of 10's in extended array notation.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">Negative gongulus was mentioned in Jonathan Bowers' article "<a href="http://www.polytope.net/hedrondude/existence.htm" rel="nofollow">Why Does God Exist?</a>", to make a point that every number has "trueness". This results in negative gongulus the least number mentioned on Bowers' entire site.</font></div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">The negative of a googolism that's at the breaking point of linear array notation. It's still huge, right, but small enough that once you learn the (relatively simple among Bowers' array notations) ruleset you can understand how this is computed.</font></div>
<div><br />

<div><font color="#ed106f" size="4"><b>Negative Graham's number</b></font></div>
<div><font color="#ed106f" size="4"><b>-G(64)</b></font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">The negative of Graham's number, a very well-known googolism. Because if a number is well-known, somebody might mention the negative of it.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#ed106f" size="4"><b>Negative giggol</b></font></div>
<div><font color="#ed106f" size="4"><b>-10^^100</b></font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">The negative of a number that's so amazingly small that it can be written using iterated exponentiation as 10^10^...^10 (with 100 10's). We are surely getting closer to zero!</font></div>
<div><br />

<div><font color="#ed106f" size="4"><b>-10^10^100</b></font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">The negative of one of two so-well-known numbers that the name "googology" is based on it. It is defined as 1 followed by googol zeroes, where googol is 1 followed by 100 zeroes.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>

<div><font color="#ed106f" size="4"><b>-10^100</b></font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">The negative of the smaller cousin of googolplex, which is 1 followed by 100 zeroes. It's so small that the universe has more Planck volumes than this number!</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#ed106f" size="4"><b>Negative million</b></font></div>
<div><font color="#ed106f" size="4"><b>-1,000,000</b></font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">We have gotten to the negative of a number that is so small that it has everyday meaning. Imagine having this as a debt (assuming you are using a denomination that has similar value to the US dollar)—that would suck.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#ed106f" size="4"><b>Negative forty</b></font></div>
<div><font color="#ed106f" size="4"><b>-40</b></font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">This number has a notable property on temperature: Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales give equal values at -40 (-40 degrees C = -40 degrees F). For every increase by 1 of the Celsius degree, the Fahrenheit degree increases by 1.8.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">For other temperature related numbers see 32, 37, 98.6, 212 and 273.15.</font></div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">As x approaches 1 from above, the double logarithm of x approaches negative infinity. But the approach happens slowly, that if you use x = 1.000001, the result is only about -6. If you enter x = 1.000...001, the number you get will be roughly equal to the number of digits after the decimal point of x. As you can see this method isn't very effective for generating large negative numbers.</font></div>

<div><font color="#96001c">The following 3 entries are minor entries just there to make the transition less abrupt. This entry would also be a minor entry if not for this description. Minor entries are typically listed in one line, don't have detailed descriptions, and shown as the same text size as other entries' descriptions. Be prepared to see a lot of these on the later parts, where we get to the vast number of googolisms defined using ExE!</font></div>

<div><font color="#ed106f" size="4"><b>-1</b></font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">This is a special negative number, and the negative of the most important number in mathematics.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">Some example of -1's use in mathematics are that any nonzero number to the power of -1 is its reciprocal (x^(-1) = 1/x), the square of the imaginary unit i^2 is equal to -1, and the famous identity e^(iπ) = -1, which can be used to find out what taking a number to the power of a complex number means.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">-1 plays a vital role in googology, as it's used to define the predecessor of any integer. It is used in the definition of the predecessor function:</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">P(n) = n<b>-1</b></font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">As well as almost all other googological functions, such as the hyper operator:</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">Rule 1. a {1} b = a + b<br />
Rule 2. a {n} 1 = a (if n&gt;1)<br />
Rule 3. a {n} b = a {n<b>-1</b>} (a {n} (b<b>-1</b>)) (if n&gt;1)</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">The subtraction of 1, which is equivalent to the addition of -1, is needed to force the evaluation of any expression back to the base case (Rules 1 and 2 in this case), so that the notation eventually terminates. Looking in this way -1 has some actual significance in googology.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">Sbiis Saibian suggests this as a boundary between "small" negative numbers and "large" negative numbers. Any negative number less than -1 is "large" and any negative number more than -1 is "small" (i.e. close to 0).</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">Another fact: According to <a href="http://googology.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Sbiis_Saibian/Introduction_to_Googology" rel="nofollow">this blog post</a>, infinity is less than zero. In fact, it's equal to -1.</font></div>

</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">This number, although negative, has an important role in googology. Say, you want to convert 2^3^4^5 into a power tower of 10's with a "smallish" number at the top. For an accurate conversion we use logarithms:
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">2^3^4^5<br />
= (10^log(2))^3^4^5 — 10^(log(x)) = x by definition<br />
= 10^(log(2)*3^4^5)<br />
= 10^(10^log(log(2))*(10^log(3))^4^5)<br />
= 10^10^(log(log(2))+log(3)*4^5)<br />
~ 10^10^(-0.521390+0.477121255*1024)<br />
~ 10^10^(-0.521390+488.572165)<br />
= 10^10^488.050775</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">This shows that if you want to calculate the topmost exponent with the precision of at least one digit after decimal point, you need to take log(log(2)) into account. This could be a big deal, considering that an increase of the topmost exponent by 0.5 results in the number (approximately) being cubed:</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">10^10^(n+0.5) = 10^(10^n*10^0.5) ~ 10^(10^n*3.1622) = (10^10^n)^3.1622</font></div>

</div>
<div><font color="#96001c">Imagine a bucket containing 10^10^n grains of sand. Imagine there are 10^10^n of such buckets in a storage room, and imagine 10^10^n such storage rooms. That's about what's needed to have 10^10^(n+0.5) sand grains. That's the difference between 10^10^n and 10^10^(n+0.5). Although in practical calculations in googology we ignore these differences as those are insignificant, sometimes when detailed calculation is needed, it is necessary to consider small numbers like this.</font></div>

<div><font color="#706200">A small number that raising 10 to the power of this number results in 2. This number has an important role in googology. Since 10^log(2) = 2, it can be used to change the base of a power tower from 2 to 10. For example, when we calculate 2^2^30:</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#706200">2^2^30<br />

<div><font color="#706200">2^2^30 ~ 10^323,228,496.622955</font></div>

</div>
<div><font color="#706200">This shows that this number (and other logarithmic numbers) is useful for changing the power's base from 2 to 10 to determine where powers of numbers other than 10 fall between the powers of 10. The negative number log(log(2)) is another number with a similar role in googology.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#706200">The logarithms of prime numbers are also useful for computing logarithms of composite numbers by factorizing them and by taking the sum of the logarithms of the factors. For example we can compute the logarithm of 32 using the logarithm of 2:</font></div>

</div>
<div><font color="#706200">This number satisfies the equality 10^log(3) = 3. Using log(2) and log(3), we can estimate the logarithm of some positive integers without a calculator. For example:</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#706200">log(108) = log(2^2*3^3) = log(2^2) + log(3^3) = 2*log(2) + 3*log(3) = 2*0.30103 + 3*0.47712 = 0.60206 + 1.43136 = 2.03342</font></div>

<div><font color="#340c02">Four is an integer that comes between 3 and 5, or S(3) using the successor function. Unlike smaller positive integers, there aren't many special words about four, except "quarter". Four can still be easily recognized, so it's considered a palpable number.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#340c02">4 is the first composite number, the second square number and the first perfect power (apart from 0 and 1), the second tetrahedral number (between 1 and 10), the third Lucas number (between 3 and 7), the first non-Fibonacci number, and the 3rd Motzkin number (between 2 and 9). It's the output of BB(2) (busy beaver function), making it a busy beaver number (between 1 and 6). It's also the output of Ξ(4) (xi function) and H(2) (hyperfactorial). The four-color theorem states that four is the minimum number of colors need to color any two-dimensional map on a plane such that adjacent countries have different colors. 4 is also the maximum number of squares needed to sum up to any positive integer.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#340c02">The prefixes for four are tetra- (ex. tetrahedron) and quad- (ex. quadruple). Both are commonly used.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#340c02">In googology, 4 is significant as the result of 2+2, 2*2, 2^2, 2^^2, 2^^^2 and all higher operators. Consequently, it can be named gartwo, fztwo, fugatwo, megafugatwo and boogatwo using the fuga- family of prefixes. Most of Bowers' linear arrays with 4 or more entries with base equal to 2 will degenerate to 2^^^...^^^2, and thus evaluate to 4 (an exception is that when the second entry is 1—in this case, the array solves to 2). 4 is also the value of any Conway's chained arrow notation expressions that start with 2→2→. 4 can also be thought as the zeroth item of the Graham's number sequence: G<sub>0</sub> = 4.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#340c02">In number names, four appears less often than three, but still common: googolquadriplex, supertet, tetralogue, Conway's tetratri etc.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#340c02">There are many things grouped in fours, since a set of four gives a feel of completeness to it. Examples include the four seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter; picture not included), legs on many animals, human blood types, DNA/RNA bases (A, C, G, T), cardinal directions (north, south, west, east), the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and the Elite Four from the Pokemon games.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#340c02">In Chinese languages, and languages that borrow letters from them (such as Japanese and Korean), the words for "four" and "death" are pronounced similarly, thus in Eastern culture, 4 is treated like what 13 is treated like in Western cultures. The phenomenon is called "tetraphobia", and <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath" rel="nofollow">there is a trope for that</a>.

<div><font color="#340c02">Five is significant as the half of our numeral base, because there are five fingers on one hand, and also five toes on one foot. This proves that five is very common in nature. Examples of things grouped in five are the five senses, and the five points on a star.

<div><font color="#490d03">The square root of 62 has a remarkable digit pattern, as shown above. 7874 is repeated, 11811 is 7874 times 1.5, and 19685 is 7874 times 2.5. Amazingly, this is not a coincidence, it arises from the fact that 999,998 = 62*127^2.</font></div>

<div><font color="#490d03">Since 7874 = 999,998/62, multiplying both sides of the latter equation by 7874 gives:</font></div>

<div><font color="#490d03">9 is the 3rd square (between 4 and 16), the 4th Motzkin number (between 4 and 21), and the smallest odd composite number. It can be named garthree using the gar- prefix. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan%27s_conjecture" rel="nofollow">Catalan's conjecture</a>, which was proven in 2002, states that 8 = 2^3 and 9 = 3^2 are the only pair of perfect powers (aside from 1st powers) that differ by 1.</font></div>

</div>
<div><font color="#490d03">9 is the maximum number of cubes needed to sum up any positive integer. However, 23 = 2^3*2+1^3*7 and 239 = 4^3*2+3^3*4+1^3*3 are the only integers that actually need nine cubes, and beyond that only eight cubes are needed. It is proven that at some point only seven cubes are necessary, but it's not proven about six or fewer cubes, although it's been proven that at least four cubes are needed to sum up any positive integer beyond a certain point.</font></div>

It is also equal to !4 using subfactorial (see 44), 3^! = 3^2^1 using exponential factorial (see 262,144), or 3* = (1+2)*3 using mixed factorial (see 6561). It's also equal to BB(2,3), the maximum number of symbols a 2-state, 3-symbol TM starting from a blank tape can leave before halting.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#490d03">9 is the largest single-digit number—beyond this point we need the help of place-value notation. Because 9 is one less than the base of our numeral system, 10, 100, 1000 and so on are all congruent to 1 mod 9. From this a simple method of divisibility test by 9, called "casting out nines". Take the sum of the digits of the number. The original number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum is. For example, 653,589 is divisible by 9 because 6+5+3+5+8+9 = 36 and 36 is a multiple of 9.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#490d03">The prefixes for nine are nona-/nov- (Latin, ex. November) and ennea- (Greek, ex. enneagon). Sometimes the nona- prefix is used in place of ennea- even when Greek prefixes are used on other numbers.</font></div>

<div><font color="#490d03">Ten is the base of our numeral system, and the most common base used. Ten glyphs (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9) are used to denote numbers. The reason why ten is widely used as a base is because a typical human has ten fingers and toes, five on each hand and foot. Other cultures used bases other than ten (such as 20 or 60), but they are often a multiple of five or ten.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#490d03">In some situations, even the small-looking ten could be considered a large number, such as inviting 10 people in a group event, eating 10 pancakes (or other similar-sized food), or a car with 10 seats. In some cases it is outright outrageous such as having 10 kids, or a movie series spanning 10 movies. Despite this, ten is so common in life that we doesn't usually realize that it's a large number in some cases. There are still some situations where ten is considered small, such as a book with 10 pages, a class with 10 students, or a bookcase with 10 books.</font></div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#490d03">The fact that ten is our base of our numeral system gives ten some cultural significance, such as a scale of 1 to 10.

<div><font color="#490d03">Ten is also the most common base for googolisms, followed by 100 or 3. The popularity of 10 stems from being the base of our numeral system and its usage in googol = 10^100. Googolisms that use 10 as their base include the -illion numbers and SI prefixes, googol, googolplex as well as their variants, megiston (10 in a circle), a majority of Jonathan Bowers' googolisms (tridecal, iteral, colossol etc.), and almost all of Sbiis Saibian's googolisms (though it's only used at the base and 100 is used on other entries).</font></div>

In this proposal we can define things like e^^^^pi or 4.6{2.5}3.8. The proposal has an old and a new version. The rules of the old version are given below:</font></div>
<div>
<ol style="color:#490d03"><li>b&gt;1 and n&gt;1: a{n}b = a{n-1}(a{n}(b-1))</li>
<li>0≤b≤1 and n&gt;1: a{n}b = a^b</li>

</div>
<div><font color="#490d03">A new version of the proposal is created to fix the issue that 2{n}2 is not always equal to 4 (for example, 2{0.5}2 = 2^2^0.5*2^(1-0.5) = 3.769083...). The first and second rules are the same, but the third rule is changed to:</font></div>
<div>
<ol start="3" style="color:#490d03"><li>0≤b≤1 and 0≤n≤1: a{n}b = a^(1+n(b-1))*b^(1-n)</li>

<div><b><font color="#a5421f" size="4">11</font></b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#490d03">11 is the 5th prime number (between 7 and 13) and the 5th Lucas number (between 7 and 18). 11 is the only palindromic prime with an even number of digits, because palindromes with an even number of digits are divisible by 11.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#490d03">11 is the smallest repunit prime. Repunit primes are primes whose decimal digits are all 1. If all decimal digits of a prime number (larger than 10) are all the same, then it should be 1 because if it was another number, then the original number would be a multiple of that digit. The next repunit prime is R<sub>19</sub> = 1,111,111,111,111,111,111.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#490d03">11 is equal to n(2) in the block sequence theorem, which is the length of the longest string x_1, x_2, ... of the letters 1 and 2 such that no block of letters x<sub>i</sub>, ..., x<sub>2i</sub> is a substring of any later block x<sub>j</sub>, ..., x<sub>2j</sub> (j&gt;i). The longest such strings that start with 1 are "12221111111" and "12221111112". Strings starting with 2 can be created by changing 1 to 2 and vice-versa.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#490d03">The square of 11 is 121, which spells out the second row of Pascal's triangle (counting the row with the single 1 as the 0th row). This continues with the next two powers: 1331, 14641. The pattern breaks at the next power of 11, which is 161,051. Powers of 1.1 work similarly, except with a decimal point after the first 1. Powers of 101, 1001 etc. also work similarly, and goes further than the powers of 11.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#490d03">This also applies to other bases: in base n, powers of n+1 are represented in base n as 11, 121, 1331, ... this pattern continues until we reach a row in Pascal's triangle whose largest entry is larger than or equal to n.</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><font color="#490d03">There are three ways to test for divisibility by 11. In each test, the original number is a multiple of 11 if and only if the result is a multiple of 11 (in two-digit numbers, have the same two digit).</font></div>
<div>
<ol style="color:#490d03"><li>Alternating addition and subtraction, starting from the right. Example: 1-2+9-5+8 = 11, so 85,921 is a multiple of 11.</li>
<li>Adding digits in groups of two, again starting from the right. The process is repeated until the result is smaller than 100 (this works because 11 is a multiple of 99). Example: 8+59+21 = 88, so 85,921 is a multiple of 11.</li>
<li>Repeatedly subtract the last digit from the rest of the digits. Example: 8592-1 = 8591, 859-1 = 858, 85-8 = 77, 7-7 = 0, so 85,921 is a multiple of 11. What's useful about this way is that it can be used to determine the quotient as well: write the subtracted digits in reverse order. In 85,921's case, the subtracted digits are 1, 1, 8, 7, so the quotient is 7811.</li>

The chained arrow expression 3→3→2→2 solves to 3→3→27, or 3^^^...^^^3 with 27 up-arrows. 27 often appears when dealing with chained arrows because the quirks in the notation causes exponents to appear in the middle of expressions (for example, 3→3→2→3 = 3→3→27→2).</font></div>

<div>36 is the 6th square (between 25 and 49), the 8th triangular number (between 28 and 45), and apart from the trivial case 1, 36 is the smallest number that's both square and triangular (larger numbers with this property are 1225, 41,616, 1,413,721...).

<div>36 is a highly composite number: a number which is a record-setter in the number of factors. In the case of 36, it has 9 factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. The first few such numbers are 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360, 720, 840, 1260, 1680, 2520, 5040, 7560, 10080, 15120, 20160, 25200, 27720, 45360, 50400, 55440, 83160, 110880, 166320, 221760, 277200, 332640, 498960, 554400, 665280, 720720, ... (OEIS <a href="http://oeis.org/A002182" rel="nofollow">A002182</a>) and 36 is the largest such number that's also a perfect power. Highly composite numbers are popular for dividing things in, such as 12 eggs, 24 hours in a day, and 60 minutes in an hour.</div>

<div>37 is the 12th prime (between 31 and 41). It is equal to hydra(3), the last value of the Kirby-Paris hydra function before the function truly blasts off. The function is defined using a single-player game with the following rules:</div>
<div>
<ol><li>Start with a finite sequence of matched parentheses with only one outermost pair, such as <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace">(((())())((()))(()(()()(()))))</span>.</li>
<li>Pick an empty pair <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace">()</span> and a natural number n.</li>
<li>Delete the empty pair.</li>
<li>If its parent is not the outermost pair, take its parent and append n copies of it.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2~4 until the sequence of parentheses is reduced to <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace">()</span>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>The parent of a pair of parentheses is the innermost pair of parentheses that encloses the pair and fully encloses all of the parentheses within the pair, and all that is within that pair. In the following example, the parent of the bold (and blue) pair is shown in red: <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace">(((())())((()))(()<font color="#ff0000">(()</font><b><font color="#0000ff">()</font></b><font color="#ff0000">(()))</font>))</span>.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Say that the empty pair chosen is always the rightmost possible one, and the number n starts from 1 and incremented by 1 every time step 2 is executed (including the first time). Then hydra(n) is defined as the number of steps to reduce <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace">((...(())...))</span> (with n+1 sets of parentheses) to <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace">()</span>. Here's how <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace">(((())))</span> is reduced using the above rules:</div>

<div>37 is the smallest irregular prime. An odd prime <i>p</i> is regular (not irregular) if it doesn't divide the numerator of any of the Bernoulli numbers B_k for k = 2, 4, ..., <i>p</i>-3. The first few irregular primes are 37, 59, 67, 101, 103, 131, 149, 157, 233, 257, 263, 271, 283, 293, 307, 311, 347, 353, 379, 389, ...

<div>Although it's proven that there are infinitely many irregular primes, it hasn't been proven for regular primes. The relative density of regular primes are conjectured to be <i>e</i>^(-1/2), or about 60.65%. (Ir)regular primes were defined by Ernst Kummer in 1850 to partially prove Fermat's Last Theorem.</div>

<div>The 14th prime (between 41 and 47).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>43 is a member of Sylvester's sequence, where the first term is two (or one - it doesn't matter much), and each term is the product of all preceding terms plus one: 2, 3, 7, 43, 1807, 3,263,443, 10,650,056,950,807... (OEIS <a href="http://oeis.org/A000058" rel="nofollow">A000058</a>) It can also be recursively defined as a(1) = 2 and a(n+1) = a(n)^2 - a(n) + 1 where a(n) is the n-th term of the sequence. This sequence grows hyper-exponentially: the number of digits of each term of the sequence grows exponentially. Examples of sequences with hyper-exponential growth are the Fermat numbers and numbers produced by the fuga- function.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Every two different term of this sequence is coprime (no prime factors in common), and it can be used to show that there are infinitely many primes (the same thing can be done with Fermat numbers). The reciprocals of the sequence's members add up to one (or two if you count 1): 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/7 + 1/43 + 1/1807 + ... = 1.</div>

<div>43 is the best-known lower bound for R(5,5) (see 18), the smallest integer n such that coloring each edge of K_n (a complete graph with n vertices) red or blue forces a monochrome K_5 as a subgraph (the upper bound is 49). A <a href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2013/coinheist.com/get_smart/halting_problem/index.html" rel="nofollow">puzzle</a> in the 2013 MIT Mystery Hunt has a program that calculates R(5,5) as one of the parts.

<div><br />

<div>Calculating booga-pi with the proposal is harder than calculating booga-e. Below I will show how to compute booga-a for 3≤a≤4. The rules are given again for convenience:</div>
<div>
<ol><li>b&gt;1 and n&gt;1: a{n}b = a{n-1}(a{n}(b-1))</li>
<li>0≤b≤1 and n&gt;1: a{n}b = a^b</li>
<li>0≤b≤1 and 0≤n≤1: Old: a{n}b = a^b^n*b^(1-n) / New: a{n}b = a^(1+n(b-1))*b^(1-n)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>Say we want to calculate a{n}b where 1≤n≤2. Let f = floor(b), and x<sub>k</sub> = a{n}(b-f+k). Then x<sub>0</sub> = a{n}(b-f) = a^(b-f) (since b-f≤1), and x<sub>k+1</sub> = a{n}(b-f+k+1) = a{n-1}(a{n}(b-f+k)) = a{n-1}x<sub>k</sub> = a^(x<sub>k</sub>^(n-1))*x<sub>k</sub>^(2-n) in the old version and a^(1+(n-1)(x<sub>k</sub>-1))*x<sub>k</sub>^(2-n) in the new version. In other words:</div>
<div>
<ul><li>If 1≤n≤2, a{n}b = x<sub>f</sub> where f = floor(b) and:</li>
<ul><li>x<sub>0</sub> = a^(b-f)</li>
<li>x<sub>k+1</sub> = a^(x<sub>k</sub>^(n-1))*x<sub>k</sub>^(2-n) (old version)</li>
<li>x<sub>k+1</sub> = a^(1+(n-1)(x<sub>k</sub>-1))*x<sub>k</sub>^(2-n) (new version)</li></ul></ul>
</div>
<div>Booga-a is defined as a{a-2}a, so letting b = a and n = a-2 gives:</div>
<div>
<ul><li>If 3≤a≤4, booga-a = a{a-2}a = x<sub>3</sub> where:</li>
<ul><li>x<sub>0</sub> = a^(a-3)</li>
<li>x<sub>k+1</sub> = a^(x<sub>k</sub>^(a-3))*x<sub>k</sub>^(4-a) (old version)</li>
<li>x<sub>k+1</sub> = a^(1+(a-3)(x<sub>k</sub>-1))*x<sub>k</sub>^(4-a) (new version)</li></ul></ul>

<div>The 9th triangular number (between 36 and 55).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>45 is the amount of degrees in a half of a right angle, which appears frequently in geometry. It is the size of both non-right angles of an isosceles right triangle (also called a 45–45–90 triangle), as well as the slope of the function y = x. (See also 1/sqrt(2) = 0.707106...)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>45 is a Kaprekar number, which is a special type of number that can be defined using the following steps:</div>
<div>
<ol><li>Given a natural number n, calculate n^2.</li>
<li>Divide n^2 by 10^d where d is the number of digits of n. Let a equal to the quotient and b equal to the remainder. In other words, a = floor(n^2/10^d) and b = n^2 mod 10^d.</li>
<li>n is a Kaprekar number if a+b = n.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>For example, 45^2 = 2025, and we divide 2025 by 10^2 to get a=20 and b=25. a+b = 20+25 = 45, so 45 is a Kaprekar number. 45 is also a Kaprekar number for cubes (45^3 = 91,125, 9+11+25 = 45) and fourth powers (45^4 = 4,100,625, 4+10+06+25 = 45).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The first few Kaprekar numbers are 1, 9, 45, 55, 99, 297, 703, 999, 2223, 2728, 4950, 5050, 7272, 7777, 9999... (OEIS <a href="http://oeis.org/A006886" rel="nofollow">A006886</a>) Repdigits frequently appear in the beginning of the sequence, but they later get overshadowed by non-repdigits (for example, there are 1035 Kaprekar numbers with 20 or less digits, while there are only 180 repdigits with 20 or less digits).</div>

<div>51 is equal to Worm(2) by a function defined using Beklemishev's worms, a construction described by Lev D. Beklemishev. Define a worm as a sequence of non-negative integers [W<sub>0</sub>, W<sub>1</sub>, ..., W<sub>n</sub>], and then solve it using what Beklemishev calls "the Worm battle". On turn m (starting from m=1), the worm W is converted to next(W,m), which is defined as follows:</div>
<div>
<ul><li>If W<sub>n</sub> = 0, next(W,m) = [W<sub>0</sub>, W<sub>1</sub>, ..., W<sub>n-1</sub>]. In other words, the last entry is chopped off.</li>
<li>Otherwise:</li>
<ul><li>Find the rightmost entry of W smaller than W<sub>n</sub>, and call that W<sub>k</sub>.</li>
<li>If such W<sub>k</sub> exists, define the good part as g = [W<sub>0</sub>, ..., W<sub>k</sub>], and the bad part as b = [W<sub>k+1</sub>, ..., W<sub>n-1</sub>, W<sub>n</sub>-1] (the last entry is decremented).</li>
<li>If no such W<sub>k</sub> exists, define g as an empty list and b = [W<sub>0</sub>, ..., W<sub>n-1</sub>, W<sub>n</sub>-1].</li>
<li>Then next(W,m) = g + b + ... + b with m+1 copies of b, where + means sequence concatenation, for example [3,2,3]+[4,9,6] = [3,2,3,4,9,6].</li></ul></ul>
</div>
<div>Beklemishev proved that the worm is eventually reduced to [] no matter what worm W is picked, and that it can't be proven in Peano arithmetic. Now we can define Worm(n) as the number of steps it takes to reduce the worm [n].</div>

<div style="color:#39494b">
<div>Radians are another way to measure angles, where 1 radian is defined as the π/2th of a right angle. The definition of radians is less arbitrary than the definition of degrees because on a θ-radian arc on a circle with radius 1, the arc length is equal to θ. Since there are π radians in a half of a circle (180˚), there are 180/π = 57.2958... degrees in a radian. This number could be thought as a number linking an arbitrary measure (degrees) to a non-arbitrary measure (radians).</div>

</div>
<div>I read on a forum post that given a large number, you can make a larger number by taking the reciprocal of it, subtracting it from 90, and taking the tangent of it (in degrees). In other words, given a number n, tan((90-1/n)˚) is a larger number. For example, doing it on 100 gives tan(89.99˚) = 5729.577... However, the result is always smaller than (180/π)*n, which is smaller than 58n. So if the number n is large enough, this method won't be very effective in generating larger numbers.</div>

In a unit where a right angle is equal to x units, doing this procedure (replacing 90 with x) will result in a number smaller than 2x/π times the number.

<div>
<ul><li>a = 0: A(0,b) = b+1</li>
<li>b = 0: A(a,0) = A(a-1,1)</li>
<li>Otherwise: A(a,b) = A(a-1,A(a,b-1))</li></ul>
</div>
<div>Using the definition directly, A(3,3)'s computation begins with:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A(3,3)</div>
<div>= A(2,A(3,2))</div>
<div>= A(2,A(2,A(3,1)))</div>

</div>
<div>... and it goes on and on, until it reaches the result 61. As you can see, using the definition directly is an inefficient way of calculating this function. There are actually some simple formulas that makes computing the Ackermann function easier, given below:</div>
<div>
<ul><li>A(0,b) = b+1</li>
<li>A(1,b) = b+2</li>
<li>A(2,b) = 2b+3</li>
<li>A(3,b) = 2^(b+3)-3</li>
<li>A(4,b) = 2^^(b+3)-3</li>
<li>A(5,b) = 2^^^(b+3)-3</li>
<li>A(a,b) = 2^^...^^(b+3)-3 (with a-2 arrows)</li></ul>
</div>
<div>Using this formula, A(3,3) = 2^(3+3)-3 = 2^6-3 = 64-3 = 61.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The gag- prefix is defined as gag-n = A(n,n). So A(3,3) can be called "gagthree". Although gagthree isn't that big, gagfour = A(4,4) is equal to 2^^(4+3)-3 = 2^2^2^2^2^2^2 - 3, which is really big compared to gagthree. By the way, gagzero = A(0,0) = 1, gagone = A(1,1) = 3, and gagtwo = A(2,2) = 7.</div>

In other words, if the number of ways expressible as a power doesn't have to be exact, then the numbers have to be 2 to the power of a highly composite number (such as 2^4 = 16, 2^6 = 64, 2^12 = 4096, 2^18 = 262,144...)</div>

<div>64 appears in the definition of Graham's number, a well-known number in googology. In the definition of Graham's number, a sequence called "Graham's sequence" is defined, and Graham's number is the 64th term of the sequence. 64 was chosen because there are 64 ways to color each line in a K<sub>4</sub> (a graph where there are 4 points and every set of two points is connected by one line) red and blue, which is a part of the question that led to Graham's number.</div>

<div>64 is called "binary-clover mite" in Saibian's nomenclature, since clover mite = 2*10^5 = 200,000 and the binary- prefix changes the base from 10 to 2, and 2*2^5 = 64. Binary-clover mite is smaller than binary-dust mite (80) and binary-cheese mite (128), even though clover mite (200,000) is larger than dust mite (50,000) and cheese mite (80,000).

For example, if something increases by 3% per year, the rule states that it will take about 72/3 = 24 years to double (actual value: 23.449 years), and if it increases by 8% per year, it will take about 72/8 = 9 years to double (actual value: 9.006 years). The actual formula involves logarithms, and this rule is used to calculate the doubling time in a much simpler way.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>72 is an approximation; it approximates 100*ln(2) = 69.3147... (the 100 comes from the fact that the amount increased is in percentages). However, as the interest rate increases, the value that makes the rule work the best increases, due to the compounding effect becoming stronger (for example 1.05^2 is larger than 1.1 and 1.05^3 is larger than 1.15). The rule of 72 produces a value closest to the real value when the interest rate is around 8%. A "rule of 70" works better for smaller percentages such as 2%, and for even smaller percentages a "rule of 69.3" is better.</div>

<div>The 24th prime (between 83 and 97).</div>

</div>
<div>89 is the 11th Fibonacci number (between 55 and 144), treating the first two 1's in the sequence as distinct. The Fibonacci sequence is a famous sequence in number theory, which starts with 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368, 75025, 121393, 196418, 317811, 514229, 832040, ... (OEIS <a href="http://oeis.org/A000045" rel="nofollow">A000045</a>)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Fibonacci sequence is defined as F<sub>1</sub> = 1, F<sub>2</sub> = 1, and F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub> for n≥3. In other words, the first two terms are 1, and each term after that is the sum of the two before it. Starting the sequence with 0 and 1 yields the same sequence, so 0 could be called the "zeroth Fibonacci number".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Fibonacci sequence arises from this famous question by Leonardo Pisano (Leonardo of Pisa, also known as Fibonacci): "Say that the rabbits produce a pair of offspring every month, starting two months after they are born. If we start with a pair of young rabbits, how many pairs will be there after a year?"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On the first month there is the original pair. On the second month a new pair is born, so there are two pairs. On the third month the original pair produces a new pair, and the second pair grow up, so there are three pairs. On the fourth month two pairs are born, bringing the total to five pairs, and so on. After 12 months passed, there are a total of F<sub>14</sub> = 377 pairs.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, with the ratio between two consecutive entries approaching the golden ratio phi = 1.618033... This property was found in the 18th century, and the occurrences of Fibonacci numbers in nature (flower petals, for example) was noticed in the 19th century.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Fibonacci sequence has many properties, such as for positive integers m and n, F<sub>m+n</sub> = F<sub>m</sub>*F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>m+1</sub>*F<sub>n</sub>, F<sub>2n+1</sub> = F<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + F<sub>n+1</sub><sup>2</sup>, F<sub>2n</sub> = F<sub>n+1</sub><sup>2</sup> - F<sub>n-1</sub><sup>2</sup>, if n is divisible by k then F<sub>n</sub> is divisible by F<sub>k</sub>, F<sub>n</sub> = ((1+sqrt(5))<sup>n</sup> - (1-sqrt(5))<sup>n</sup>)/(2<sup>n</sup> * sqrt(5)), there are F<sub>n+1</sub> ways to express n as a sum of 1's and 2's (if order matters), etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The reciprocal of 89 is a rational number with a repeating pattern of 44 digits: 0.<b>01123595505617977528089887640449438202247191</b>011235... It is also equal to the sum of F<sub>n</sub>/10<sup>n+1</sup> from n=1 to infinity, which is the follows:</div>
<div><br />

<div>----------------</div>
<div> 0.0112359550...</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At first, the fact that this sum creates a repeating decimal seems surprising. This makes 89 especially interesting Fibonacci number in base 10. A similar thing happens with the reciprocal of 9899.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This sum can be performed in other bases. In base 2, the sum is 1.0, and in base 3, the sum is 1/5 = 0.01210121...<sub>3</sub>. In general, in base b, the sum is 1/(b<sup>2</sup>-b-1). It's a nice coincidence that when b=10, b<sup>2</sup>-b-1 is a Fibonacci number.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>89 is also a Fibonacci prime, which is a Fibonacci number that is prime. It can be shown that if a|b (a is a divisor of b) then F<sub>a</sub>|F<sub>b</sub>. Therefore if F<sub>n</sub> is prime, then n should be prime, with the sole exception being F<sub>4</sub> = 3. The first few Fibonacci primes are 2, 3, 5, 13, 89, 233, 1597, 28,657, 514,229, 433,494,437, ... (OEIS <a href="http://oeis.org/A005478" rel="nofollow">A005478</a>)</div>

<div>100 is the 10th square (between 81 and 121), and the square of the base of our numeral system. 100 is the sum of the first 9 primes: 2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23 = 100, and a sum of consecutive cubes: 1<sup>3</sup>+2<sup>3</sup>+3<sup>3</sup>+4<sup>3</sup> = 100. Adding more cubes always result in squares: 100+5<sup>3</sup> = 225 = 15<sup>2</sup>, 225+6<sup>3</sup> = 441 = 21<sup>2</sup>, 441+7<sup>3</sup> = 784 = 28<sup>2</sup> etc. This happens because the sum of the first <i>n</i> cubes is equal to the square of the <i>n</i>-th triangular number (i.e. sum of the first n positive integers): 1<sup>3</sup>+2<sup>3</sup>+...+<i>n</i><sup>3</sup> = (n(n+1)/2)<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Being the square of our base, 100 is given special names in almost all languages, such as "hundred" in English, "cent" in French, "ekato" in Greek, "bai" in Chinese, and "sto" in Russian.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A hundred is the smallest number we learn as a big number. It's just large enough to be easily called large, yet still not too large. Therefore this number is used in many places where a "just large enough" number is needed, such as top 100 lists. However some believe the smallest large number should be a different number such as a thousand, million or a googol. Sbiis Saibian argues on <a href="http://beyondg.blogspot.com/2012/02/very-small-very-large-numbers.html" rel="nofollow">a blog post</a> that a large number should be any number larger than 1.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Googology Wiki used to have a rule where only finite numbers larger than or equal to 100, and when articles for numbers less than 100 were created in the Made-up Number Era (and some before that), they were deleted to enforce the rule. So back then, in GWiki's definitions, 100 was the smallest large number. In early 2013, the rule was removed, and pages for positive integers less then 100 were created, but not for most irrational constants (although the article E exists as a disambiguation page).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Hundred is very commonly used in googology, probably because of its use in googol = 10^100 and googolplex = 10^10^100, the codifiers of googology. Examples of googolisms that use 100 in their definitions are giggol, grangol and boogol.</div>

<div>The prefixes for 100 are centi- (Latin) and hecto- (Greek). The centi- prefix is used in centipede, century, percent, centillion etc. The SI prefixes for 100 and 0.01 derive from them, which are hecto- for 100 and centi- for 0.01.</div>

<div>127 is the 4th Mersenne prime (between 31 and 8191). A Mersenne number is a number of the form 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>-1, and a Mersenne prime is a Mersenne number that is prime. In some places the notation M<sub><i>n</i></sub> refers to the <i>n</i>-th Mersenne number (i.e. 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>-1), while in others it refers to the <i>n</i>-th Mersenne prime. In this list I'm going to use the former definition (M<sub><i>n</i></sub> = 2<i><sup>n</sup></i>-1). To a Mersenne number be a Mersenne prime, its exponent also has to be a prime number.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Mersenne primes are famous because the largest known prime at a given time was almost always a Mersenne prime, because they are easier to test than other numbers of similar size. There are 49 Mersenne primes known, and the current record holder (as of September 2016), M<sub>74,207,281</sub>, is over 22 million digits long.</div>

<div>127 is the 31st prime (between 113 and 131) and the 7th Motzkin number (between 51 and 323). Interestingly 31 and 7 are also Mersenne primes. 127 is also a member of the primeth recursion sequence (between 31 and 709). </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It's the fourth Catalan–Mersenne number, which is a member of the sequence 2, M_2, M_(M_2), M_(M_(M_2)) etc. The sequence starts with the four terms 2, 3, 7 and 127. The next term, 2^127-1, has also been shown to be prime, but the next term, 2^(2^127-1)-1, is far too large to test with current methods and technology. Due to the prime exponent requirement for a Mersenne number to be prime, if a member of the sequence is composite, then all the members after that would be also composite.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>127 is also the fifth Friedman number because its Mersenne number expression 2<sup>7</sup>-1 is composed of the digits 1, 2 and 7.</div>

<div>In computing, 127 is the largest number that can be stored using the 8-bit (1-byte) integer format (known in the C programming language as char), which stores integers from -128 to 127, inclusive. Byte integers are used when there's a need to save space and the numbers needed are small enough. For limits of other integer formats, see 32,767, 2,147,483,647 and 9,223,372,046,854,755,097.</div>

</div>
<div style="color:#666666">
<div>292 is a number that appears in one of the first few entries of π's continued fraction expansion. A continued fraction is a way to express a number like so:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>a</i> + 1/(<i>b</i> + 1/(<i>c</i> + 1/(<i>d</i> + 1/(<i>e</i> + ...))))</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The above continued fraction can be written more simply as <i>a</i>; <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It has been proven that the length of the continued fraction of a number is finite if and only if the number is rational, and there are exactly two continued fraction representations if the number is rational, or a unique representation if it's irrational.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Some irrationals have nice continued fractions, such as <i>e</i>: 2; 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, ... while some don't, such as π: 3; 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 14, ... (OEIS <a href="http://oeis.org/A001203" rel="nofollow">A001203</a>)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What's notable about pi's continued expression is that you can cut off everything from 292 and beyond:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3 + 1/(7 + 1/(15 + 1/(1 + 1/(292 + ...))))</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>to make:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3 + 1/(7 + 1/(15 + 1/1)) = 3 + 1/(7 + 1/16) = 3 + 1/(113/16) = 3 + 16/113 = 355/113 = 3.141592920354...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>which is a famous approximation to π that matches up to the first six decimal digits. The reason why this approximation is so accurate is because the discarded terms 1/(292 + ...) is quite small, and doesn't affect the result by a big amount. Additionally, cutting the terms from 15 and beyond creates the approximation 22/7.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There are also generalized continued fractions, where the numerators need not be 1. It can be used to express π with a nice pattern, such as 4/(1 + 1<sup>2</sup>/(2 + 3<sup>2</sup>/(2 + 5<sup>2</sup>/(2 + ...)))) or 2 + 2/(1 + 1*2/(1 + 2*3/(1 + 3*4/(1 + ...)))).</div>

<div>381 is equal to <i>g</i>(6) using the weak Goodstein function. The function is defined using <i>weak Goodstein sequences</i>, which are defined below:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Suppose we want to create a weak Goodstein sequence starting with n. First, represent n in base 2, for example 36 = 2^5+2^2. Then the next term is calculated by bumping the base to 3 and subtracting one. In the case of 36, we get 3^5+3^2 - 1 = 251. To calculate the next term, do the same thing again, but this time use base 3 and turn the 3's into 4's, and the next term is created by using base 4 and turning 4's into 5's, and so on. For example, the weak Goodstein sequence for 36 goes as follows:</div>
<div>
<ul><li><i>g</i><sub>0</sub>(36) = 36 = 2<sup>5</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup></li>
<li><i>g</i><sub>1</sub>(36) = 3<sup>5</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> - 1 = 251 = 3<sup>5</sup> + 2*3 + 2</li>
<li><i>g</i><sub>2</sub>(36) = 4<sup>5</sup> + 2*4 + 2 - 1 = 1033 = 4<sup>5</sup> + 2*4 + 1</li>
<li><i>g</i><sub>3</sub>(36) = 5<sup>5</sup> + 2*5 + 1 - 1 = 3135 = 5<sup>5</sup> + 2*5</li>
<li><i>g</i><sub>4</sub>(36) = 6<sup>5</sup> + 2*6 - 1 = 7787 = 6<sup>5</sup> + 6 + 5</li></ul>
and so on.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The weak Goodstein function <i>g</i>(<i>n</i>) is defined as the number of steps the sequence starting with <i>n</i> takes to reach 0. The sequence will eventually reach 0 (after possibly a very large number of steps) no matter which value is picked.</div>

<div>420 is the <i>weak factorial</i> of 7 (7w!, between 60 and 840). The weak factorial of <i>n</i> (can be notated <i>n</i>w!) is defined as the smallest positive integer divisible by (i.e. the least common multiple of) all integers from 1 to <i>n</i>. 420 is the weak factorial of 7, and the smallest weak factorial that isn't a highly composite number (but the next three weak factorials are). Weak factorial was defined by Cookie Fonster when he was in elementary school, as an analogue of the factorial function that grows slower.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The sequence of weak factorial numbers starts 1, 2, 6, 12, 60, 60, 420, 840, 2520, 2520, 27,720, 27,720, 360,360, 360,360, 360,360, 720,720, 12,252,240, 12,252,240, 232,792,560, 232,792,560, 232,792,560, 232,792,560, 5,354,228,880, ... (OEIS <a href="https://oeis.org/A003418" rel="nofollow">A003418</a>)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It can also be recursively defined as 1w! = 1, (<i>n</i>+1)w! = <i>np</i> (if <i>n</i> = <i>p</i><i><sup>k</sup></i> where <i>p</i> is a prime number and <i>k</i> is a positive integer), and (<i>n</i>+1)w! = <i>n</i>w! (otherwise). This means that the weak factorial values increase only when the input is a prime power (such as 8 and 343, but not 36 and 225). Therefore there exist regions where the weak factorial values stay the same for a long time.</div>
<div><br />

<div>420 is a well-known cult number relating to the marijuana culture (which produced the memes "420 blaze it" and "smoke weed everyday"), which is an order of magnitude above 42, another cult number.</div>

<div>In one of the beta versions of <i>Cookie Clicker</i>, the prices and CpS (cookies per second) of the buildings switched from manually chosen values to outputs of a formula. Due to the CpS formula chosen, without any upgrades, each mine produced exactly 69 cookies per second, and each factory produced exactly 420 cookies per second. In more recent beta versions and the live 2.0 version, the CpS formula was adjusted to produce lower values.</div>

<div>496 is the third perfect number (between 28 and 8128). A <i>perfect number</i> is a rare kind of number whose divisors (other than itself) add up to itself. In 496's case, the divisors 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124 and 248 add up to 496. The sequence of perfect numbers starts with 6, 28, 496, 8128, then jumps to 33,550,336, 8,589,869,056, 137,438,691,328, 2,305,843,008,139,952,128, ... (OEIS <a href="https://oeis.org/A000396" rel="nofollow">A000396</a>)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Perfect numbers that are even have a connection to Mersenne primes: each of them has the form (2<sup><i>p</i></sup>-1)×2<sup><i>p</i>-1</sup> = 2<sup>2<i>p</i>-1</sup> - 2<sup><i>p</i>-1</sup> where 2<i><sup>p</sup></i>-1 is prime, or in other words a Mersenne prime multiplied by the largest power of two less than that prime. For example:</div>
<div>
<ul><li>6 = 3×2 = 2<sup>3</sup> - 2<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>28 = 7×2<sup>2</sup> = 2<sup>5</sup> - 2<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>496 = 31×2<sup>4</sup> = 2<sup>9</sup> - 2<sup>4</sup></li>
<li>8128 = 127×2<sup>6</sup> = 2<sup>13</sup> - 2<sup>6</sup></li></ul>
</div>
<div>Therefore, for each Mersenne prime, there's a corresponding perfect number. It has also been proven that all even perfect numbers have this connection to Mersenne primes. It is not known if there are any odd perfect numbers, and if there's one it should be at least 10<sup>1500</sup>.</div>
<div><br />
</div>

<div>666 is a famous number described in the Book of Revelation of the Bible as the number of the beast, representing evil. It is what Robert Munafo and others call "the mother of all cult numbers"; but first, let's learn some mathematical properties of this number:</div>
<div>
<ul><li>The 36th triangular number, i.e. the sum of the first 36 integers</li>
<li>The largest triangular number that's also a repdigit</li>
<li>The sum of the squares of the first seven primes</li>
<li>A Smith number (666 = 2*3*3*37, 2+3+3+3+7 = 18 = 6+6+6, see 728)</li>
<li>Many more</li></ul>
</div>
<div>The number appears in the following passage of the Bible:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<blockquote style="margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;padding:0px">
<div>"Let anyone who has intelligence calculate the number of the beast, for it is a human number: this number is six hundred sixty six."</div>
</blockquote>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For this reason, it has become the greatest cult number in history. People tried to find out how the passage that introduced the number connects to 666, such as the possible connection to Roman emperor Nero, who would have been considered evil by the early Christians due to being contemporary to them, so the Christians made a covert accusation against Nero. Also, people has drawn many (sometimes arbitrary) connections between 666 and other numbers, such as 1998 and 39.</div>
