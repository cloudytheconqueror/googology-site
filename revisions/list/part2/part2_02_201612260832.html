<div>One thousand is the 10th cube (between 729 and 1331) and the cube of the base of our numeral system. Like 100, 1000 is given special names in most languages, such as "thousand" in English, "mille" in Latin, "chilia" in Greek, "qian" in Chinese, and "tysyacha" in Russian.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1000 is used as a base in Western numeral systems—most named numbers beyond 1000 are a power of 1000 (million = 1000<sup>2</sup>, billion = 1000<sup>3</sup>, etc.) and numbers with many digits often have their digits grouped by 3 to make it easier to read (for example 323,228,496 instead of 323228496).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A thousand could be considered a pretty big number, as a thousand things is pretty tricky to visualize in your head. However, it can still be considered to be a small number in some places. For example, a thousand dollars is a big amount of money (though it's still an everyday occurrence), while a thousand Korean won is worth about two-thirds of a package of snacks. For most people, thousand temporarily holds the honor for the largest number they've heard of, before being replaced by actual "really big numbers" such as a million.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The SI prefix for a thousand is kilo- (from Greek), and its inverse is milli- (from Latin), which both originates from words meaning "thousand". The prefix milli- is used in words like "millenium" and "millipede".</div>

<div style="color:#00599e">
<div>One thousand one is a product of three consecutive primes: 1001 = 7*11*13. The sequence of such numbers starts with 30, 105, 385, 1001, 2431, 4199, 7429, 12,673, 20,677, 33,263, 47,027, 65,231, 82,861, ... (OEIS <a href="http://oeis.org/A046301" rel="nofollow">A046301</a>) This leads to a test of whether a number is divisible by 7, 11 or 13: Detach the last 3 digits of the number and calculate the difference between it and the remaining digits. Repeat until the number is less than 1000, and check if that number is divisible by 7, 11 or 13. For example, with 22,993,047, 22,993 - 47 = 22,946, and 946 - 22 = 924. 924 is a multiple of 7 and 11 but not 13, so 22,993,047 is a multiple of 7 and 11 but not 13.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This property of 1001 also causes some primorials and highly composite numbers to have repeating digits: 30,030, 510,510 and 9,699,690 in case of primorials, and 720,720, 1,081,080, 1,441,440, 2,162,160, 2,882,880, 3,603,600, 4,324,320, 6,486,480, 7,207,200, 8,648,640, 10,810,800 and 14,414,400 in case of highly composite numbers.</div>

<div>1024 is the second dekeract (10-D cube), the fourth penteract (5-D cube), the 32nd square and the tenth power of 2. Powers of two have many unique properties, such as 2<sup>n</sup> being the number of subsets of a set with n elements, the sum of the numbers on the (n+1)-th row of Pascal's triangle is equal to 2<sup>n</sup>, and the reciprocals of the powers of two add up to 2.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The sequence of powers of two starts 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16,384, 32,768, 65,536, 131,072, 262,144, 524,288, 1,048,576, 2,097,152, 4,194,304, 8,388,608, 16,777,216, 33,554,432, 67,108,864, 134,217,728, 268,435,456, 536,870,912, 1,073,741,824, 2,147,483,648, 4,294,967,296, 8,589,934,592, ... (OEIS <a href="https://oeis.org/A000079" rel="nofollow">A000079</a>) Powers of two are a popular thing to memorize, and I've memorized up to 134,217,728 myself.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1024 is a special power of two for human usage, since it's 2 to the power of 10 and it's close to 1000, a power of ten. This means that every power of two in the sequence will be about a thousand times larger than the one that's ten terms before.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since 1024 is close to 1000, the computer industry has adopted the prefixes kilo-, mega- etc. to refer to powers of 1024 rather than 1000 (for example, a kilobyte = 1024 bytes rather than 1000). To avoid confusion, the binary SI prefix system was created, which uses 1024 as the base. The prefixes in the system are (mirroring the kilo-, mega-, etc. prefixes):</div>
<div>
<ul><li>kibi- = 2^10 = 1024</li>
<li>mebi- = 2^20 = 1,048,576</li>
<li>gibi- = 2^30 = 1,073,741,824</li>
<li>tebi- = 2^40 = 1,099,511,627,776</li>
<li>pebi- = 2^50 = 1,125,899,906,842,624</li>
<li>exbi- = 2^60 = 1,152,921,504,606,846,976</li>
<li>zebi- = 2^70 = 1,180,591,620,717,411,303,424</li>
<li>yobi- = 2^80 = 1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176</li></ul>
</div>
<div>1024 can be called "binary-guppyspeck" using Saibian's nomenclature, which is formed by applying the binary- prefix to guppyspeck, which is in turn formed by applying the -speck suffix to guppy. Guppy is 10^20, the -speck suffix reduces the exponent by 10, and the binary- prefix changes the base to 2, so guppyspeck = 10^(20-10) = 10^10, and binary-guppyspeck = 2^10 = 1024.</div>

<div>If you take any 3-digit number that's not the same in reverse, take the difference with it and its reversal, then the sum of the result and its reversal would almost always be 1089. For example, 612 - 216 = 396, and 396 + 693 = 1089.</div>

<div>Sometimes you get 198 as the result of the above process (for example, 352 - 253 = 99, and 99 + 99 = 198). In which case you can calculate the sum of it and its reversal again to get 1089.</div>
