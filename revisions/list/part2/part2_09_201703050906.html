<div>One thousand is the 10th cube (between 729 and 1331) and the cube of the base of our numeral system. Like 100, 1000 is given special names in most languages, such as "thousand" in English, "mille" in Latin, "chilia" in Greek, "qian" in Chinese, and "tysyacha" in Russian.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1000 is used as a base in Western numeral systems—most named numbers beyond 1000 are a power of 1000 (million = 1000<sup>2</sup>, billion = 1000<sup>3</sup>, etc.) and numbers with many digits often have their digits grouped by 3 to make it easier to read (for example 323,228,496 instead of 323228496).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A thousand could be considered a pretty big number, as a thousand things is pretty tricky to visualize in your head. However, it can still be considered to be a small number in some places. For example, a thousand dollars is a big amount of money (though it's still an everyday occurrence), while a thousand Korean won is worth about two-thirds of a package of snacks. For most people, thousand temporarily holds the honor for the largest number they've heard of, before being replaced by actual "really big numbers" such as a million.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The SI prefix for a thousand is kilo- (from Greek), and its inverse is milli- (from Latin), which both originate from words meaning "thousand". The prefix milli- is used in words like "millenium" and "millipede".</div>

</div>
<div style="color:#00599e">
<div>One thousand one is a product of three consecutive primes: 1001 = 7*11*13. The sequence of such numbers starts with 30, 105, 385, 1001, 2431, 4199, 7429, 12,673, 20,677, 33,263, 47,027, 65,231, 82,861, ... (OEIS <a href="http://oeis.org/A046301" rel="nofollow">A046301</a>) This leads to a test of whether a number is divisible by 7, 11 or 13: Detach the last 3 digits of the number and calculate the difference between it and the remaining digits. Repeat until the number is less than 1000, and check if that number is divisible by 7, 11 or 13. For example, with 22,993,047, 22,993 - 47 = 22,946, and 946 - 22 = 924. 924 is a multiple of 7 and 11 but not 13, so 22,993,047 is a multiple of 7 and 11 but not 13.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This property of 1001 also causes some primorials and highly composite numbers to have repeating digits: 30,030, 510,510 and 9,699,690 in case of primorials, and 720,720, 1,081,080, 1,441,440, 2,162,160, 2,882,880, 3,603,600, 4,324,320, 6,486,480, 7,207,200, 8,648,640, 10,810,800 and 14,414,400 in case of highly composite numbers.</div>

<div>1024 is the second dekeract (10-D cube), the fourth penteract (5-D cube), the 32nd square and the tenth power of 2. Powers of two have many unique properties, such as 2<sup>n</sup> being the number of subsets of a set with n elements, the sum of the numbers on the (n+1)-th row of Pascal's triangle is equal to 2<sup>n</sup>, and the reciprocals of the powers of two add up to 2.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The sequence of powers of two starts 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16,384, 32,768, 65,536, 131,072, 262,144, 524,288, 1,048,576, 2,097,152, 4,194,304, 8,388,608, 16,777,216, 33,554,432, 67,108,864, 134,217,728, 268,435,456, 536,870,912, 1,073,741,824, 2,147,483,648, 4,294,967,296, 8,589,934,592, ... (OEIS <a href="https://oeis.org/A000079" rel="nofollow">A000079</a>) Powers of two are a popular thing to memorize, and I've memorized up to 134,217,728 myself.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1024 is a special power of two for human usage, since it's 2 to the power of 10 and it's close to 1000, a power of ten. This means that every power of two in the sequence will be about a thousand times larger than the one that's ten terms before.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since 1024 is close to 1000, the computer industry has adopted the prefixes kilo-, mega- etc. to refer to powers of 1024 rather than 1000 (for example, a kilobyte = 1024 bytes rather than 1000). To avoid confusion, the binary SI prefix system was created, which uses 1024 as the base. The prefixes in the system are (mirroring the kilo-, mega-, etc. prefixes):</div>
<div>
<ul><li>kibi- = 2^10 = 1024</li>
<li>mebi- = 2^20 = 1,048,576</li>
<li>gibi- = 2^30 = 1,073,741,824</li>
<li>tebi- = 2^40 = 1,099,511,627,776</li>
<li>pebi- = 2^50 = 1,125,899,906,842,624</li>
<li>exbi- = 2^60 = 1,152,921,504,606,846,976</li>
<li>zebi- = 2^70 = 1,180,591,620,717,411,303,424</li>
<li>yobi- = 2^80 = 1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176</li></ul>
</div>
<div>1024 can be called "binary-guppyspeck" using Saibian's nomenclature, which is formed by applying the binary- prefix to guppyspeck, which is in turn formed by applying the -speck suffix to guppy. Guppy is 10^20, the -speck suffix reduces the exponent by 10, and the binary- prefix changes the base to 2, so guppyspeck = 10^(20-10) = 10^10, and binary-guppyspeck = 2^10 = 1024.</div>

<div>The number 1729 was made famous by a story involving Hardy and Ramanujan, both being early 20th century mathematicians. When Hardy visited Ramanujan who was in the hospital, he was picked up in a cab numbered 1729. Hardy told Ramanujan that 1729 isn't an interesting number, in which Ramanujan replied that he considered it an interesting number because it is the smallest positive integer that can be represented as the sum of two positive cubes in two non-trivial ways: 1729 = 12<sup>3</sup> + 1<sup>3</sup> = 1728 + 1, and 1729 = 10<sup>3</sup> + 9<sup>3</sup> = 1000 + 729.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A generalization of this idea leads to the <i>taxicab numbers</i>. The <i>x</i>-th taxicab number is the first positive integer expressible as a sum of two positive cubes in <i>x</i> different ways. The currently known taxicab numbers are 2, 1729, 87,539,319, 6,963,472,309,248, 48,988,659,276,962,496, and 24,153,319,581,254,312,065,344 (OEIS <a href="https://oeis.org/A011541" rel="nofollow">A011541</a>).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If we allow the cubes to be zero or negative as well, we get the cabtaxi numbers (see 91). See 50 and 65 for a similar property with squares.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1729's property also makes it a near-miss to Fermat's Last Theorem: 10<sup>3</sup>+9<sup>3</sup> is only 1 apart from 12<sup>3</sup>. Fermat's Last Theorem is a famous theorem that states that for all integer <i>n</i>&gt;2, there are no non-trivial integer solutions <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> to the equation <i>a</i><sup><i>n</i></sup> + <i>b</i><sup><i>n</i></sup> = <i>c</i><sup><i>n</i></sup>. It was conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in the 17th century and caused over 300 years of effort by mathematicians to prove it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If a solution <i>a</i><sup><i>n</i></sup> + <i>b</i><sup><i>n</i></sup> = <i>c</i><sup><i>n</i></sup> existed for <i>n</i> = <i>pq</i> where <i>p</i>, <i>q</i> &gt; 2, it could be rewritten as (<i>a</i><sup><i>p</i></sup>)<sup><i>q</i></sup> + (<i>b</i><sup><i>p</i></sup>)<sup><i>q</i></sup> = (<i>c</i><sup><i>p</i></sup>)<sup><i>q</i></sup>. With this and the proof for <i>n</i>=4 (provided by Fermat himself), it can be shown that we only need to prove this problem for the odd prime exponents. Many specific cases for the problem was proven, such as the proof for <i>n</i>=3 by Euler and the proof up to <i>n</i>=4,000,000 using computer techniques, but the full proof wasn't given until 1994 by Andrew Wiles, whose proof utilized elliptic curves, something seemingly unrelated to the theorem.</div>

Since the entry for the largest defined number in professional mathematics was discontinued back in 1980, many people think that Graham's number is still the largest number defined in professional mathematics. In actuality, now the title belongs to a much larger number (examples of larger numbers in professional mathematics are TREE(3) and SCG(13)). Sbiis Saibian has written <a href="http://beyondg.blogspot.com/2008/06/1977-is-over-so-is-g.html" rel="nofollow">a blog post</a> where he rants about Graham's number's popularity.</div>

<div>1995 was the year I was born. 1995 has an interesting property I found in a puzzle book: 19 is a divisor of 95, 199 is a divisor of 995, 1999 is a divisor of 9995, and so on. In other words, 19|95, 199|995, 1999|9995, etc. 1664 and 4998 also have this property.</div>

<div>Another connection between 1998 and 666 is that if you divide the digits of the fourth, fifth or sixth power of 666 in groups of three from the right, taking the sum of these groups results in 1998 (a property similar to the Kaprekar numbers—see 45). For example, 666<sup>6</sup> = 87,266,061,345,623,616, and 87+266+61+345+623+616 = 1998.</div>

<div>2047 is the smallest Mersenne number with a prime exponent that's not prime (see 127 for more about Mersenne numbers/primes).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In ancient times, people thought that for every prime <i>p</i>, 2<i><sup>p</sup></i>-1 is prime. This holds for the first 4 primes: 2<sup>2</sup>-1 = 3, 2<sup>3</sup>-1 = 7, 2<sup>5</sup>-1 = 31, 2<sup>7</sup>-1 = 127 are all primes. However, the next term gives the smallest counterexample to the statement, as when <i>p</i>=11, 2<sup>11</sup>-1 = 2047 = 23×89.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It can be shown that if <i>c</i> is composite and has a factor <i>x</i> larger than 1, then 2<i><sup>x</sup></i>-1 is a factor of 2<i><sup>c</sup></i>-1. So if the exponent is composite, the Mersenne number is also composite. But the opposite doesn't hold, as the above counterexample demonstrates.</div>
