# Cloudy's googology
This is the new home for my googology site, originally hosted on Google Sites.

The `docs` folder contains the (current) site itself.

The `sources` folder contains the sources for each page in the original site (before being processed by Google Sites).

The `revisions` folder contains the revisions for each page (after being processed, because I couldn't retrieve the original sources for the revisions).
