<div><font size="4"><b>Eighty three</b></font></div>
<div><font size="4"><b>83</b></font></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The 23rd prime (between 79 and 89).</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>83 is the number of right-truncatable primes in base 10. A right-truncatable prime is a prime that is one digit long or can be turned into another right-truncatable prime by removing the rightmost digit. The largest is 73,939,133 (see that entry for more).</div>

<div><span style="line-height:1.5;background-color:transparent">Scott Aaronson's essay "<a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/bignumbers.html">Who Can Name the Bigger Number?</a>" starts with the following paragraph:</span></div>
<div><br>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote style="margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;padding:0px">
<div>
<div>In an old joke, two noblemen vie to name the bigger number. The first, after ruminating for hours, triumphantly announces "Eighty-three!" The second, mightily impressed, replies "You win."</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Of course, in later parts of this list, we'll introduce numbers that make the nobleman's 83 look tiny.</div>

<div><b><font size="4">163</font></b></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>163 is the 37th prime number.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Previously, people misunderstood the definition of mixed factorial (see 6561) as 1+(2*(3^(...((x-1){x-3}x)...))), when it should be (...((((1+2)*3)^4)^^5)...){x-3}x. Using the misunderstood definition, tetrafact or 4* evaluates to 1+(2*(3^4)) = 1+(2*81) = 1+162 = 163, while using the correct definition, 4* = ((1+2)*3)^4 = (3*3)^4 = 9^4 = 6561.</div>

<div><font size="4"><b>314.0109844...</b></font></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The value of booga-pi = pi{pi-2}pi using Nayuta Ito's new proposal. It's a nice coincidence that this value is close to 100*pi. See also 43.82590562...</div>

<div><b><font size="4">2187</font></b></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>3 to the 7th power (3^7) equals 2187.&nbsp;It can be named ternary-pipsqueak using pipsqueak (10^7) and the ternary- prefix (which changes the base of the exponentiation to 3).</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Personal: The number 2187 was on the license plate on one of my family's cars my parents drove when I was young. Korean car license plates has a two-digit number, a Korean letter, and a four-digit number on it. Older versions also include the region.</div>
<div><br>

<div><b><font size="4">Two thousand one hundred ninety seven / Great baker's gross</font></b></div>
<div><b><font size="4">2197 = 13^3</font></b></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The 13th cubic number (13^3). Note that it's only one digit apart from 2187. It's sometimes called <i>great baker's gross</i> as an analogy to a great gross and a baker's gross.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>
<div><b><font size="4">Five thousand nine hundred thirty nine</font></b></div>
<div><b><font size="4">5939</font></b></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>5939 is one of my favorite random numbers. When I was a grade schooler, there was a book in the school library about adventures of an anthropomorphic frog. Each book in the library had its own ID starting from 1 and increasing (like other libraries), and the ID of that book was 5939. From then on (or later?) I started using 5939 in some my website accounts (along with many other numbers), including my Gmail address, where the part that comes before the at sign is "cloudy5939".</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>5939 is also a right-truncatable prime (see 73,939,133), and the only four-digit right-truncatable prime that starts with 5.</div>
</div>

<div><b><font size="4">Six thousand five hundred sixty one / Tetrafact</font></b></div>
<div><b><font size="4">4* = 9^4 = 6561</font></b></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Tetrafact is a googolism defined using SpongeTechX's mixed factorial (SpongeTechX is a GWiki user), which is defined as x* = (...((((1+2)*3)^4)^^5)...){x-3}x (note the left-to-right order; see 163). Tetrafact is 4* = ((1+2)*3)^4 = (3*3)^4 = 9^4 = 6561. It is the ninth tesseract number (9^4) and 3 to the 8th power (3^8).</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Tetrafact is not to be confused with tet<b>h</b>rafact, which is E100(#^^#)^#100 in extended cascading-E (a much, much larger number).</div>

<div>A number with four different names in Saibian's nomenclature.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>If two different expression with different names happen to produce the same value, they are considered distinct googolisms and therefore given different numberings.</div>

<div><b><font size="4">Alpha</font></b></div>
<div><b><font size="4">[A] = 12,549,900</font></b></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The number "Alpha" given in Sbiis Saibian's <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/largenumbers/home/1-1/4">Jacob's Ladder</a> article. In the article, the number n is notated as (AAAAA...AAAAA) with n A's. The bulk of the article contains a "massive" number, which is (AAAAA...AAAAA) with 167,332 A's. Then Saibian defined Alpha as 167,332 lines of A's, each containing 75 A's, with the entire thing contained between parentheses. The result is a number with 167,332*75 = 12,549,900 A's between parentheses.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Saibian decided to call the number with Alpha lines of 75 A's between ()'s Beta, and the number with Beta lines is called Gamma, and Delta and Epsilon are created in the same way. Then he devised a shorthand for these: Alpha = [A] (note the square brackets), Beta = [AA] = 941,242,500, Gamma = [AAA] = 70,593,187,500 etc.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>This is followed by many extensions, which began by putting Alpha A's between square brackets and giving it the notation [[A]], and then putting that many A's between square brackets and calling it [[[A]]] and so on. Then Saibian created a sequence where the first term is [A], and the terms after that are defined as [...[A]...] with the number of pairs of brackets equal to the previous term, and it gets worse from there.</div>

<div>The third smallest integer of the form (10^(p-1)-1)/p where p is prime (here p=11) â€” this number, although its decimal expansion looks simpler, doesn't have the fascinating properties of 142,857.</div>

</div>
<div>This is the total number of cats in Mew-Genics, wherever that is. It was listed on Aarex's Mega Numbers List along with two lower bounds and upper bounds (which are available on this list as minor entries). It was supposed to come out on 2014, however it didn't came out yet, as far as I know.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Aarex's Mega Numbers List has some amazing features including formatting inconsistencies, several groups containing no entries at all, incorrect facts, and a weird color scheme. Though the last one could be considered hypocritical because this list's color scheme is also a bit weird.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Aarex has since started a new number list and the Mega Numbers List was deleted. However, Cookie Fonster has a page called "<a href="http://cookiefonster.blogspot.com/2015/03/analyzing-aarexs-number-list-archived.html">Analyzing Aarex's Number List</a>", which was formerly a page on the <i>Pointless Large Number Stuff</i> but now moved to his blog.</div>

<div><b><font size="4">Ten trigintillion</font></b></div>
<div><b><font size="4">10^94</font></b></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>This is the number of volumes of Wolfgang H. Nitsche's multi-volume book <i><a href="http://www.googolplexwrittenout.com/">Googolplex Written Out</a></i>, which includes the entire decimal expansion of googolplex.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Each volume consists of 405 pages, of with 400 pages actually containing the digits. Each digit-containing page includes 2500 zeroes, with the exception of page 5 which has 20 less zeroes, and page 404 which has 20 more. Therefore each volume includes 1,000,000 zeroes, so there are a googol zeroes total in the entire 10^94 volume book. Page 5 of the first volume also contains the digit 1, the first digit of googolplex.</div>

<div><br>
</div>
<div>This was the first gigantic prime (primes with 10,000 or more digits) discovered. It was found by Nelson and Slowinski in 1979.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Curious fact: The first three Mersenne prime exponents that start with 4 are 4253, 4423 and 44,497. 4253 starts with one 4, 4423 starts with two 4's, and 44,497 starts with three 4's. However, the next exponent that start with 4, 42,643,801, doesn't follow that pattern.</div>

<div><br>
</div>
<div>This Fermat number is the smallest Fermat number that's not known to be either prime or composite. Considering it has over two billion digits, it is currently too large to test for primality. It became the smallest Fermat number with unknown primality when a factor of F<sub>31</sub> was found in April 2001.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>This number is equal to one plus googolpleiv, since 4^4^16 = 2^(2*4^16) = 2^(2*2^32) = 2^2^33.</div>

<div><b><font size="4">Grangol-carta-gralgathor</font></b></div>
<div><b><font size="4">E100#^#^##100#100</font></b></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Here we encounter the -carta- infix. An infix, analogous to a prefix and a suffix, is a root that's put in-between words.</div>
<div>If a googolism X is represented as E%, and Y as @100, then X-carta-Y is defined as @%. X-carta-Y, "carta" meaning "map" in Greek, can be thought as "mapping" X to Y. In this example, X is grangol = E100#100, Y is gralgathor = E100#^#^##100, so @ = E100#^#^## and % = 100#100, resulting in grangol-carta-gralgathor = E100#^#^##100#100.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The -carta- infix was first introduced in 2014 when xE^ was released, then later retroactively applied to earlier Saibianisms (like this one) when the list of number names was greatly expanded.</div>

It is an extension of Monster-Giant, which is E100(#^^#)^(#^^#)^#100. #^^#&gt;2 means (#^^#)^^# by the way.</div>
